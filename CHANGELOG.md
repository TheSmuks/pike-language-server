# Changelog

All notable changes to the Pike Language Server project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html/).


## [0.6.6] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

  - Rename now returns a descriptive `ResponseError` instead of silent `null`
    when no renamable symbol is at the given position or the new name matches
    the old name.
  - Autodoc renderer sanitizes HTML entities (`<`, `>`, `&`) and escapes
    markdown metacharacters in inline content to prevent injection from
    user-written Pike doc comments.

### Changed

  - `implementationProvider` and `diagnosticProvider` capabilities are now
    declared in the server's initialize response, enabling clients to discover
    these features correctly.
  - `safeParse()` in `DiagnosticManager` now passes the document URI to the
    parser cache, avoiding redundant re-parses on every diagnostic cycle.
  - PikeWorker priority queue replaced with three FIFO sub-queues (interactive,
    normal, background). Dequeue is now O(1) instead of O(n) linear scan.

### Added

  - CodeLens provider tests: 7 tests covering reference count lenses, self-
    reference exclusion, singular/plural titles, and mixed declaration scenarios.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.4] — 2026-05-15

### Added

  - Directory module convention: files inside `Foo.pmod/` now automatically
    see symbols from `Foo.pmod/module.pmod` without explicit `inherit`/`import`.
    This works for hover, go-to-definition, and completions. Pike's module
    system treats `module.pmod` as the implicit parent of all files in the
    same directory module.

## [0.6.5] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

  - Unreachable code lint (P3003) no longer flags `break` after `return` or
    `continue` in a switch case segment. Break-after-return is a common
    defensive pattern (prevents accidental fallthrough if return is later
    removed) and is harmless.
  - Unreachable code lint (P3003) no longer flags comments after a terminator.
    Comments are not executable code and were incorrectly included in the
    named-children scan. Affects both regular blocks and switch case segments.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.3] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

  - Unreachable code lint (P3003) no longer flags subsequent `case`/`default`
    clauses in a `switch` statement after a `return` or `break`. Each case
    is an independent control-flow entry point. Unreachable code within a
    single case segment is still correctly flagged.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

  - Hover on cross-file inherited members (e.g. `d->speak()` where `speak`
    comes from an inherited class in another file) now resolves correctly.
    The reference position matcher was using exact character match instead
    of range-based matching, so hovering anywhere other than the start of
    the identifier would fail.
  - Cross-file hover range now highlights the identifier in the requesting
    document instead of pointing to the declaration in the target file.


## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-15

### Added

  - **Intelligent LSP features**: Complete implementation of the intelligent
    features plan (E1-E5, F1-F5, G1-G2, H1-H2, AU1, GS1):

  - **Fast lint layer** (E1-E5): Real-time syntax diagnostics on every keystroke
    via tree-sitter — unused variables/parameters (P3001/P3002), unreachable
    code (P3003), missing return statements (P3004), unused imports (P3005).
    Suppressed on lines where Pike compiler provides diagnostics.

  - **Type-aware completion** (F1): Chained call type inference via
    `resolveChainedType` and `decomposePostfixChain`. Completes members through
    multi-step `d->get_dog()->bark()` chains.

  - **Constructor and method signature help** (F2-F3): Resolves `Dog("Rex",`
    to constructor `create()` params, and `d->bark("hi",` to method signature
    via type -> class -> method lookup.

  - **Commit characters** (F4): `.` and `(` as commit characters in completion
    items for immediate acceptance.

  - **Auto-import suggestions** (F5): When typing an unqualified identifier
    matching a stdlib symbol (e.g., `get_v`), offers completion with
    `additionalTextEdits` that inserts `inherit Module;`. Uses reverse index
    from stdlib-autodoc.json. Suppresses when module is already inherited.

  - **Inlay type hints** (G1): Shows inferred types for untyped variable
    declarations.

  - **Parameter name inlay hints** (G2): Shows `param:` labels at call sites.
    Handles `comma_expr` unwrapping and arrow/dot method resolution. Requires
    tree-sitter-pike v1.2.2+ (issue #18 fixed).

  - **PikeWorker pre-warming** (H1): `warmUp()` during initialization eliminates
    ~200ms cold start on first completion/hover request.

  - **Arity quick-fix** (H2): Code action for "Wrong number of arguments to foo()"
    diagnostics — adds or removes argument slots.

  - **Autodoc template generation** (AU1): Type `//!!` above a function, method,
    class, or variable declaration. Code action replaces it with a `//!` autodoc
    skeleton populated with parameter names and return type sections.

  - **Getters/setters generation** (GS1): Code action on class member variables
    generates `get_name()` / `set_name(value)` methods. Uses declared type for
    return/parameter types. Skips if method already exists.

  - **Call hierarchy**: Incoming/outgoing call hierarchy support
    (`textDocument/callHierarchy`).

  - **Complex type rename support**: `collectTypeRefsRecursive()` now recurses
    `function_type` nodes, ensuring rename propagates through compound type
    annotations like `array(Dog)` and `mapping(Dog:int)`.

  - **Recursive `.pmod` directory discovery**: The harness now recurses into
    `.pmod` directories (which are directories, not files) to discover nested
    Pike sources like `module.pmod` and `helpers.pike`.

  - Updated tree-sitter-pike WASM to v1.2.2 (fixes bare function call parsing,
    issue #18).

### Changed

  - **SignatureHelp rewrite**: `extractCalleeInfo()` now returns `objectName`
    for method calls. `resolveMethodOnType()` does type -> class -> method
    lookup. `resolveConstructor()` uses range overlap for scope discovery.

  - **Removed client-side tree-sitter syntactic provider**
    (`TreeSitterSyntacticProvider`): Server semantic tokens and VSCode TextMate
    grammar already cover all highlighting. The client-side provider was
    redundant and has been deleted.

  - **Hardened `build-vsix.sh`**: `vsce` binary is now resolved from `$PATH`
    with fallback to `$HOME/.bun/bin/vsce` instead of using a hardcoded
    absolute path.

  - **`release.yml` uses `.latest-vsix`**: The upload step now reads the exact
    VSIX path written by `build-vsix.sh`, eliminating BUILD_NUM skew between
    build and release steps.

  - **`ci.yml` uses `$PIKE_VERSION` variable**: Replaced hardcoded `8.0.1116`
    in PATH and PIKE_BINARY entries with the existing `PIKE_VERSION` env var.

### Fixed

  - **Parser cache corruption in tests**: `parse()` uses incremental parsing
    with old tree cache keyed by URI. Tests reusing the same URI across
    different sources got garbled parse trees. Fixed with unique URIs per test.

  - **Non-null assertion safety in completion**: Replaced unsafe `child(0)!`
    with a null-checked loop in dot-access completion, preventing potential
    crashes on unexpected tree-sitter node structures.

  - **Harness uses `PIKE_BINARY` for outer invocation**: `runIntrospect()` was
    passing `PIKE_BINARY` to the introspect script (correct) but using a
    hardcoded `"pike"` string for the outer process that runs the script.

  - **Removed dead `getErrorCount` import** from `client/extension.ts`.

  - **Removed dead `treeSitterProvider` tests**: Two `it.skip` tests that
    referenced the deleted provider have been removed. The remaining output
    channel test is documented as a manual smoke test.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-14

### Added

  - **Clickable `#include` navigation**: CTRL+CLICK on `#include "file"` directives
    now navigates to the target file. Also exposed as document links (underlined
    clickable path). Requires tree-sitter-pike v1.1.3+ for structured `preproc_include`
    node with `path` field.

  - **Corpus manifest management tool** (`scripts/manifest.ts`): Scans `corpus/files/`,
    parses `manifest.md`, detects drift between disk state and manifest entries.
    Supports `--sync` to apply changes, `--version <VERSION>` to bump the manifest
    version. Registered as `pike-corpus-manifest` Hermes skill.

  - **4-space indentation default**: New Pike files now default to 4-space
    indentation via `configurationDefaults` in the extension manifest. Configurable
    per-workspace and per-file through VSCode settings.

  - **Repository-based TextMate grammar**: Rewrote `pike.tmLanguage.json` with a
    repository-based structure using standard scope names (`storage.type.pike`,
    `entity.name.function.pike`, `entity.name.type.class.pike`, `variable.parameter`).
    Ensures consistent syntax highlighting across all VSCode themes.

### Changed

  - **Formatter default tab size**: Changed from 2-space to 4-space fallback when
    VSCode does not pass explicit formatting options.

  - **PikeWorker idle eviction**: Now calls `this.stop()` instead of raw
    `this.proc.kill("SIGTERM")`, ensuring SIGKILL escalation and proper cleanup
    on idle timeout.

  - **PikeWorker pending rejection**: `stop()` now rejects all pending promises
    in the response map before clearing it, preventing leaked promises on restart.

### Fixed

  - **EACCES during background indexing**: Permission errors (EACCES, EPERM, ENOENT)
    during workspace file indexing are now logged as warnings instead of errors
    and excluded from the error count. Expected on shared servers with inaccessible
    directories.

  - **Cross-file go-to-definition**: Navigation on imported/inherited symbols now
    uses `decl.sourceUri` to navigate to the original source file, not the file
    where the symbol was inherited into.

  - **Implicit class navigation fallback**: `import Foo` and `inherit Animal` now
    navigate to the top of the target `.pike`/`.pmod` file when no explicit `class`
    declaration is found (covers the common case where a `.pike` file IS the class).

  - **Corpus manifest sync**: 10 new corpus files that were on disk but not in the
    manifest have been added: `basic-int-ranges.pike`, `basic-string-types.pike`,
    `basic-type-conversions.pike`, `cross_import_a.pmod`, `err-syntax-partial.pike`,
    `err-type-member.pike`, `import-relative.pike`, `stdlib-array.pike`,
    `stdlib-mapping.pike`, `stdlib-string.pike`.

  - **Updated tree-sitter-pike WASM** to v1.1.3 with structured `preproc_include`
    node (upstream fix for TheSmuks/tree-sitter-pike#17).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed

  - **Angle-bracket `#include <file>` navigation**: CTRL+CLICK and document links
    now resolve `#include <stdio.h>` directives against Pike's system include paths
    (from `pike --show-paths`). Previously these were explicitly skipped with a
    `return null` bail-out.

  - **UriError on Windows paths**: Replaced fragile `"file://" + encodeURI(path)`
    URI construction with Node.js `pathToFileURL()` across all handlers
    (definition, document link, background index). The old pattern produced
    malformed URIs on paths containing special characters, causing VSCode to
    throw "UriError: Scheme contains illegal characters".

  - **Fact-check audit of `docs/known-limitations.md`**: Corrected 5 factual
    errors — stale "PARTIALLY RESOLVED" / "MOSTLY RESOLVED" statuses for
    `for_statement` and `switch_statement` (both fully resolved), removed a
    fabricated `BLOCK_SCOPES` constant reference, removed stale line-number
    anchors from `typeof_()` entries, and fixed corrupted severity table headers.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-05-14

### Added

  - **SIGKILL escalation in PikeWorker.stop()**: If the Pike subprocess does not
    exit within 3 seconds of SIGTERM, the server escalates to SIGKILL. This
    prevents zombie Pike processes on shared SSH dev servers where resources are
    limited.

  - **Process signal handlers in server main.ts**: `process.on('exit')`,
    `process.on('SIGTERM')`, and `process.on('SIGINT')` handlers now call
    `worker.stop()` as a last resort, ensuring the Pike subprocess is cleaned up
    even when the Node server process is force-killed.

  - **Stale VSIX cleanup**: `build-vsix.sh` removes old VSIX files from `out/`
    before creating a new one. Previously they accumulated indefinitely.

  - **Shutdown test suite** (`tests/lsp/shutdown.test.ts`): 22 tests covering
    PikeWorker.stop() (subprocess termination, SIGKILL escalation, queue cleanup,
    idempotency), server onShutdown (diagnosticManager disposal, index clearing,
    autodoc cache clearing, LSP shutdown protocol), force-close resilience, and
    createPikeServer interface contract.

### Changed

  - **install-extension.sh**: Removed redundant `bun run build:extension` step
    (already done by `build-vsix.sh`). Cleaned up phase numbering.

### Fixed

  - **Build suffix doubling**: `build-vsix.sh` now strips any existing `+NNNNNN`
    build suffix from the version string before appending a new one, preventing
    corrupted version strings like `0.4.2+704238+704238`.

  - **VSIX install path mismatch**: `install-extension.sh` reads the actual VSIX
    path from a `.latest-vsix` marker file produced by `build-vsix.sh`, instead of
    guessing the filename. Previously it looked for `pike-language-server-0.4.2.vsix`
    (no suffix) but the build produced suffixed names.

  - **Stale OutputChannel logs**: `activate()` now calls `outputChannel.clear()`
    before logging anything. VSCode OutputChannel content survives window reloads,
    which caused old version entries from previous installs to accumulate and appear
    as if multiple versions were running simultaneously.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-13

### Added

  - **Structured init logging**: The entire extension startup sequence is now
    logged as numbered steps across both client and server. Each step logs
    before and after execution, so the last logged step identifies where
    startup failed. Client logs to the "Pike Language Server" output channel
    (`[init] step 1/6` through `step 6/6`). Server logs to stderr before
    connection (`[init] step 1/5` through `5/5`) and to the LSP console after
    (`[init] step 6` through `7e`). Tree-sitter initialization on the client
    side logs `[tree-sitter] step 1/4` through `4/4` to the VSCode console.

  - **Centralized error logging**: All server-side errors now route through
    `server/src/util/errorLog.ts` (`logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError`). The format
    is `<ISO timestamp> <LEVEL> <message>`. Zero `connection.console.log/error`
    calls remain outside the logging module itself.

  - **Status bar error badge**: The status bar shows `(N errors)` with error
    styling when the server reports errors. Clicking opens the output channel.

  - **Global error handlers**: `main.ts` installs `uncaughtException` and
    `unhandledRejection` handlers before any other code runs, ensuring startup
    crashes are logged instead of silently swallowed.

### Fixed

  - **Dual connection.listen() crash**: Removed the `isDirectExecution()` entry
    block from `server.ts`. When esbuild bundled both `server.ts` and `main.ts`,
    two `connection.listen()` calls executed on the same stdio transport,
    corrupting LSP protocol state and causing `FullTextDocument._content` to
    become `undefined` — the root cause of "Cannot read properties of undefined
    (reading 'charAt')" on file open.

  - **Portable snapshot paths**: The harness now normalizes absolute paths
    embedded in Pike diagnostic messages (e.g. include resolution errors)
    using a `<ROOT>` placeholder. The `cpp-include.pike` snapshot no longer
    contains a machine-specific path, fixing CI on different environments.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-13

### Fixed

  - **Client-side tree-sitter initialization**: `TreeSitterSyntacticProvider.#init()`
    now calls `Parser.init()` before `Language.load()`. Without this call, the
    Emscripten WASM runtime (`C`) was never initialized, causing all tree-sitter
    operations on the client side to fail silently. This was the root cause of
    missing syntax highlighting and the "Unable to open: Cannot read properties of
    undefined (reading 'charAt')" error in v0.4.0.

  - **VSIX packaging**: `build-vsix.sh` now copies `web-tree-sitter.wasm` to
    `client/dist/` in addition to `server/dist/`. The client resolves WASM paths
    relative to `extension.cjs` (which lives in `client/dist/`), so the runtime WASM
    must be present there for `Parser.init()` to succeed.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added

  - **pike-fmt integration**: `scripts/fmt.sh` wrapper and `fmt:check`/`fmt:write`
    npm scripts for formatting Pike source files in the repo. CI checks formatting on
    every push/PR via the `pike-fmt` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - **tree-sitter highlights for Neovim/Helix**: `queries/highlights.scm` provides
    syntax highlighting queries for nvim-treesitter and Helix via tree-sitter.
    Captures include `@keyword.import` for inherit/import, `@function.method`,
    `@variable.parameter`, `@constant`, and `@preproc`.

  - **TextMate grammar test**: `harness/__tests__/tmLanguage.test.ts` validates
    that the grammar JSON contains all required keyword patterns.

  - **languageConfiguration test**: `tests/lsp/languageConfiguration.test.ts`
    validates that `language-configuration.json` is valid JSON with all required keys.

  - **Skipped cross-file completion test**: `tests/lsp/completion.test.ts` includes
    a skipped test for cross-file inherited member completion, referencing the
    known limitation entry in `docs/known-limitations.md`.

  - **Open Issues tracked**: `TRACKING.md` Open Issues table now tracks
    TextMate grammar tokenization coverage and cross-file inherited member completion.

  - **tree-sitter workarounds annotated**: `server/src/features/declarationCollector.ts`
    now includes `TODO(tree-sitter-pike#2)` and `TODO(tree-sitter-pike#4)` markers
    on the remaining tree-sitter-pike grammar workarounds.

  - **Cross-file inheritance gap documented**: `docs/known-limitations.md` now
    documents that `Dog d; d->` returns only same-file members when `Dog`
    inherits from a cross-file class.

  - **AI agent scaffolding documented**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` now includes an
    "AI Agent Scaffolding" section describing `.omp/skills/` conventions.

  - **Neovim/Helix highlights documented**: `docs/other-editors.md` now includes
    setup instructions for nvim-treesitter and Helix tree-sitter queries.

### Changed

  - **Text document sync**: Switched from Full to Incremental sync
    (`TextDocumentSyncKind.Incremental`). Client now sends only the changed
    range per keystroke instead of the entire document, reducing latency on
    large files. Decision 0023.

  - **PikeWorker priority queue**: Converted the PikeWorker FIFO queue to a
    priority queue. Interactive requests (hover, completion, navigation) are
    now serviced before background work (diagnostics), preventing visible
    latency when the diagnostic manager is busy. Decision 0024.

  - **Completion quality**: Added `filterText` to all completion items so the
    client fuzzy-matches against the plain identifier regardless of label
    content. Added `detail` (type annotation) to declaration completions.

  - **Cancellation propagation**: Added `CancellationToken` checks to all LSP
    request handlers that were missing them: documentSymbol, documentHighlight,
    foldingRange, signatureHelp, codeAction, workspace/symbol, and formatting.
    All handlers now bail early when a newer request supersedes them.

  - **Selection range**: Implemented `textDocument/selectionRange` for
    shrink/expand selection. Walks the tree-sitter AST from cursor position
    upward, collecting ranges for meaningful node types (declarations, blocks,
    expressions). Decision 0025.

  - **On-type formatting**: Added `documentOnTypeFormatting` provider triggered
    by `}` and `;`. Reuses the existing pike-fmt formatter but returns only
    the edits near the trigger line for responsiveness. Decision 0025.

  - **Completion textEdit**: All completion items now include a `textEdit`
    that replaces the identifier prefix being typed. Fixes the "foo.bbar"
    doubling bug when completing after a dot. Decision 0025.

  - **Completion snippets**: Function and method completions now include
    LSP snippet tab stops for parameters (e.g., `write(${1:string})`).
    Gracefully degrades to plain insertion when type info is unavailable.
    Decision 0025.

  - **Call hierarchy**: Implemented `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy`,
    `callHierarchy/incomingCalls`, and `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls`.
    Incoming calls use the cross-file reference index. Outgoing calls walk
    the tree-sitter AST to find `call_expression` nodes and resolve callees.
    Decision 0026.

  - **Code lens**: Added reference count annotations above function and
    method declarations. Uses the workspace index to count references across
    the workspace. Decision 0026.

  - **Code actions**: Added three new code action kinds:
    `source.fixAll` (apply all quick-fixes at once),
    `source.organizeImports` (sort and deduplicate import statements),
    `refactor.extract.variable` (extract selected expression to a local
    variable with auto-generated name). The codeActionProvider now
    advertises all supported kinds for VSCode's lightbulb menu.

  - **Syntax highlighting**: Expanded TextMate grammar (`client/syntaxes/pike.tmLanguage.json`)
    from 6 patterns (comments + strings only) to 21 patterns covering keywords
    (control flow, declaration, other), modifiers, type keywords, built-in constants,
    preprocessor directives, operators, and punctuation. Keywords, types, operators,
    and constants are now colorized immediately on file open with zero indexing delay.
    Previously only comments and strings were highlighted.

  - **Removed build artifacts**: `out/pike-language-server-*.vsix` and scratch
    files `test2.md`, `test-changelog.md` are no longer tracked by git.

  - **pike-fmt upgraded to v0.1.5**: Uses npm semver (`^0.1.5`). The npm package
    bundles `tree-sitter-pike.wasm` in `dist/`. `.pmod` files are now discovered
    by `pike-fmt` ([TheSmuks/pike-fmt#17]). `scripts/fmt.sh` sets `PIKE_FMT_WASM`
    to bypass a bundled-`__dirname` bug in `dist/cli.js` ([TheSmuks/pike-fmt#16]).
    A `postinstall` script (`scripts/postinstall-pike-fmt.js`) symlinks
    `web-tree-sitter.wasm` into `dist/` for the bundled tree-sitter runtime.

### Fixed

  - **Critical: client-side tree-sitter WASM loading broken** — esbuild's CJS output
    set `import.meta` to an empty object, making `import_meta.url` undefined.
    `web-tree-sitter` could not locate its WASM runtime, silently breaking
    semantic token highlighting in the editor.  The build script now patches
    the bundled output so `import_meta.url` resolves to the bundle's real path.

  - **Server `isMain` detection broken in Node.js** — `import.meta.main` is a
    Bun-only property; in Node.js it is always `undefined`, so the fallback
    branch never called `connection.listen()`.  Production use was unaffected
    (the `PIKE_LSP_STDIO` env-var guard in `main.ts` covers that), but running
    the server standalone under Node.js silently exited.  Replaced with a
    `process.argv[1]` comparison that works in both runtimes.

  - **Typecheck errors**: Fixed 21 TypeScript errors introduced in Phases B–D
    that were not caught locally. Added `'method'` to the `DeclKind` union type
    and all `Record<DeclKind, ...>` maps. Fixed `Reference` property access
    (`ref.line` → `ref.loc.line`) in call hierarchy and code lens. Fixed
    `SelectionRange` property access (`lastRange.start` →
    `lastRange.range.start`) in selection range. Fixed wrong variable name
    (`stdlibTopLevel` → `stdlibTopLevelNames`) in completion cache reset.

  - **Cross-file inherited member completion tests**: Fixed two structural syntax
    errors in `tests/lsp/completion.test.ts` that prevented cross-file inheritance
    completion tests from executing:
    1. Missing `});` closing brace on the US-001 test (~line 988), causing it to
       merge with the subsequent test.
    2. Extra `});` at end of file (~line 1286), causing a parse error.
    Removed the `describe.skip("Cross-file inherited member completion")` placeholder
    — the feature was already fully implemented; only the tests were broken.
    All cross-file inheritance tests now pass (US-001, CB-2, US-002, US-007, US-008).

  - **sigHelp.second-param SKIP → PASS**: `resolveSignature()` in
    `server/src/features/signatureHelp.ts` was looking up the class scope
    with `table.scopes.find(s => s.declarations.includes(classDecl.id))`.
    `Dog`'s `scopeId` is the file scope, not the class scope, so this
    returned the file scope — which does not contain `create`'s ID. The
    `createDeclId` was always `undefined`, causing the constructor lookup
    to fall through to stdlib (no `predef.Dog`) and return `null`.
    Fix: use `findClassScope(table, classDecl)` from `typeResolver.ts`,
    which correctly finds the class body scope via `kind === 'class'`
    and range containment.

  - **textDocument/references respects includeDeclaration**: The `onReferences`
    handler now adds the declaration location to the results when
    `params.context.includeDeclaration` is `true`, in both cross-file and
    same-file paths with duplicate-avoidance logic.

  - **documentLink fallback for unresolvable modules**: `collectInheritLink`
    in `documentLink.ts` now emits a `pike://modules/...` link even when the
    module cannot be resolved, instead of silently omitting the link.

  - **health-check.ts test suite**: Fixed 6 needle/position issues and 1 test
    structure error in the LSP health-check test file (`tests/health-check.ts`):
    `refs.method`, `refs.parameter`, `rename.prepare-valid`, `rename.execute`,
    `highlight.variable`, `hover.variable-type`, and `codeAction.unused-var`.

## [0.3.3-beta] — 2026-05-05
## [0.3.5-beta] — 2026-05-06
