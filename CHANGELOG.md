## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

  - **sigHelp.second-param SKIP → PASS**: `resolveSignature()` in
    `server/src/features/signatureHelp.ts` was looking up the class scope
    with `table.scopes.find(s => s.declarations.includes(classDecl.id))`.
    `Dog`'s `scopeId` is the file scope, not the class scope, so this
    returned the file scope — which does not contain `create`'s ID. The
    `createDeclId` was always `undefined`, causing the constructor lookup
    to fall through to stdlib (no `predef.Dog`) and return `null`.
    Fix: use `findClassScope(table, classDecl)` from `typeResolver.ts`,
    which correctly finds the class body scope via `kind === 'class'`
    and range containment.
