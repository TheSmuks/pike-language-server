## Resolved Upstream Issues

### ~~Unicode identifiers not parsed correctly~~ — RESOLVED

**Upstream issue**: [TheSmuks/tree-sitter-pike#1](https://github.com/TheSmuks/tree-sitter-pike/issues/1)

**Fixed in**: tree-sitter-pike commit `28a8ae8` — identifier grammar now uses `\p{L}` and `\p{N}` Unicode property escapes.

**LSP update**: WASM binary updated, test updated from "expects truncation" to "expects full Unicode identifier." No workaround code was needed — the LSP already handled partial results gracefully.

## Current Upstream Limitations

None known.
